# Weather
This is a Data Engineering Project that obtains data from Weather Underground and ultimately provides a web-site serving weather conditions.  The data pipeline was built in the cloud using Amazon EC2, Kinesis Firehose, EMR Spark Cluster, and S3.  

Please refer to [Weather_Presentation.ipynb](https://github.com/mike-seeber/Weather/blob/master/Weather_Presentation.ipynb) for a graph of the full data pipeline and explanation of the project.
